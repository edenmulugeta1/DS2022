root@ip-172-31-33-79:/home/ubuntu# jq
jq - commandline JSON processor [version 1.7]

Usage:  jq [options] <jq filter> [file...]
        jq [options] --args <jq filter> [strings...]
        jq [options] --jsonargs <jq filter> [JSON_TEXTS...]

jq is a tool for processing JSON inputs, applying the given filter to
its JSON text inputs and producing the filter's results as JSON on
standard output.

The simplest filter is ., which copies jq's input to its output
unmodified except for formatting. For more advanced filters see
the jq(1) manpage ("man jq") and/or https://jqlang.github.io/jq/.

Example:

        $ echo '{"foo": 0}' | jq .
        {
          "foo": 0
        }

For listing the command options, use jq --help.
